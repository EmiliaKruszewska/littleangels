                    <q>It is a pleasure for me to share with you, that my 97-year-old mother, has been in the competent care of Little Angels Home Care for nearly 3 years now and I have only wonderful things to say about the agency. Ewe G. never once let our family down, when we needed someone to care for mom and even on short notice. The ladies, to whom we have entrusted momâ€™s care, have been kind and professional and mom was always cealn, well-fed, and content when we came home. It has been a godsend for our family to have found Little Angels Home Care.</q>
